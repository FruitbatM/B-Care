# Overview

The project was created as part of part of **Women in Tech Hackathon** with **Code Institute**. The project is developed using Python,JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap framework.

# User Experience (UX)
## Strategy
### Project Goals

**Users**
- To navigate the website easily and understand its purpose.

TBA

**Site Owner**
- To be able to approve/delete stories as an admin user.
- Attractive and good quality UI design.

## User Stories

TBA

## Scope

The site will be fully responsive mobile first website. Many features will be available that allow the user to engage and find needed information fast and easy.

The site consists of a homepage which gives an overview of the site purpose with a brief overview of the site purpose, share a story, chat and news sections respectively. Second page is Breast Cancer Awareness page which gives prevention and early detection tips.

## Structure

## Skeleton
The wireframes were created in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

Wireframes created at the start of the project for desktop and mobile can be viewed on the below links:

## Design
### Color Scheme

Delicate and soothing color palette will be chosen and the balance with calmer, contemporary mood for the audience will be tried to get achieved. Below colors will be used for the website:

- Middle Blue (#56C3D4)

- Lavander Blush (#B3D5D2)
- Azure X 11 Web Color (#EAF4F5)
- Illuminating Emarald (#149285)
- Amaranth Pink (#FFA7B3)
- Metallic Seaweed (#4A8493)

<h2 align="center"><img src="readme/general/color_palette.png" alt="color palette" target="_blank" width="70%" height="70%"></h2>

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a color palette.

Shades of blue and pink colors will be selected as the primary colors because these colors are associated with Breast Cancer Awareness month. Actually pink is primarily associated; however, our team believes that men should be equally represented.

White color will be used primarily as the background color because it represents reverence, purity, and innocence. This association calms people and influences their brain activity in a very positive way.

Metallic Seaweed (#4A8493) will be used only for footer section and it combines great with the blue and pink colors on the website.

## Fonts

- Two fonts will be used throughout the project, **Montserrat** and **Roboto**. Both will be used with ``sans-serif`` font as a fallback.

- These fonts pair very well together and make the website appear both prestigious and contemporary. This font combination looks elegant and highly readable.

- Fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

# Testing

## Version Control

# Deployment

## Local Installation

### Clone the GitHub Repository

### Install project dependencies

- Install project requirements by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Create a database on MongoDB

Register for a free account with [MongoDB](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register)

- Create a new Project and call it 'b-care'
- Create a Cluster, choose the free tier option and select your region
- Create a new database and call it 'bcare_db'
- Create Collections named **TBA**

Detailed db scheme is available below:

**TBA**

### Deploy locally
- To run the project locally, in the terminal type `python3 app.py`
- This will open a localhost address, which is provided in the CLI
- Either copy and paste the url into a new browser tab, or hover over it and click the link

### Deploy to Heroku

The website of this project requires back-end technologies such as server, application, and database so the website is deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), which is a cloud platform with a service supporting several programming languages, because GitHub can only host a static websites.

Before deploying the website to Heroku, there are three important steps to follow to make the application work in Heroku correctly.

1. Create `requirements.txt` file that contains the names of packages being used in Python. It is important to update the file if other packages or modules are installed during the project.
2. Create `Procfile` that contains the name of the application file so that Heroku knows what to run.
3. Push them into GitHub.

Once above steps have been followed the website can be deployed. Please find the steps of the deployment in Heroku:

1. Create an account in [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/login)
2. Click **New** & **Create new app** to create a new app
3. Put an app name, which must be unique, choose a region and click create app
4. Go to **Deploy** section and click **Connect to GithHub**
5. Search for the repository by the repository name and connect it
6. Before clicking Enable Automatic Deploys, hidden variables such as IP address, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGO_DATABASE need to be recorded in Heroku. Go to **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars** and fill out necessary keys and values.
7. Once all the hidden variables are recorded, then click **Enable Automatic Deploys** and click **Deploy Branch** (Main should be selected unless you want other branches to be deployed).
8. When the app is deployed by Heroku correctly, there is a confirmation message and you can access the app.

**Note**<br>
*It is important NOT to set `debug=True` when deploying the website.*

                    Breast cancer is a disease where malignant (cancerous) cells form in the breast.
                    The facts remain that while women and men of any age can be diagnosed with breast cancer,
                    most women diagnosed with breast cancer are over the age of 50, but younger women and men can also get breast cancer.
                    About 1 in 8 women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. There's a good chance of recovery if it's detected at an early stage.

                        Currently there is not sufficient knowledge on the causes of breast cancer, therefore, early detection of the disease 
                        remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control. When breast cancer is detected early, and if adequate 
                        diagnosis and treatment are available, there is a good chance that breast cancer can be cured. If 
                        detected late, however, curative treatment is often no longer an option.

                        The majority of deaths occur in low- and middle-income families, where most women with breast cancer are diagnosed in late stages due mainly to lack of awareness on early detection and barriers to health services.
